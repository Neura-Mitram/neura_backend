# Neura Backend - Contribution Guide

Welcome contributors! This document explains the development workflow for Neura Backend. Please follow these guidelines carefully.

## üåø Branch Structure
- `main` **Protected Production Branch**  
  (Admin-only merges after CI/CD checks)
- `dev` **Primary Development Branch**  
  (All contributor work happens here)

```bash

cd neura_backend

2. Switch to Dev Branch

git checkout dev

3. Create Feature Branch (Directly from dev)
bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
(Replace your-feature-name with brief description)
